# Dard GEO AI Traffic dashbord website


 This project aims to develop an advanced traffic management website solution that
 leverages predictive analytics to enhance commuter experiences and improve
 road safety. The key objectives include predicting rush hour patterns,
 assessing traffic status, analyzing accident causes, and estimating vehicle flow.
 Utilizing a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, we
 implemented KMeans clustering for rush hour predictions, Random Forest for
 traffic status evaluation, and XGBoost for accident cause classification.
 Additionally, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were employed to
 predict the number of cars in traffic flow, while RNN (Recurrent Neural
 Network) models were used to forecast accident locations. A YOLO (You Only
 Look Once) model was integrated for vehicle counting and speed monitoring,
 providing real-time insights into traffic density. A Retrieval-Augmented
 Generation (RAG) model was incorporated to answer user queries about the
 data, enhancing engagement and accessibility. The solution is visualized
 through an interactive Dash app that simulates traffic conditions and accident
 hotspots, made publicly accessible via Ngrok. Our findings indicate significant
 improvements in traffic prediction accuracy and user interaction, highlighting
 the potential for data-driven approaches in urban mobility management. This
 project underscores the importance of utilizing advanced technologies to
 address the growing challenges of traffic congestion and safety in urban
 environments.
